#Zig Justification

The assignment does not explicitly require additional programming languages; however, we consider it valuable to explore the areas where AI tooling will struggle as this is potentially the area the presents the greatest value proposition for Software Engineers.

Zig is an emerging programming language that targets the systems level with extreme portability, complete control, and high performance/efficiency. Due to the migration of the core language off of github to hosting sites that do not exfiltrate their code to LLM datasets, the AI tools may struggle with writing this code. 

While it remains to be seen whether tools that delibritely obfuscate their access and data from AI will find continued utility or not, we will continue with this experiment for internal company evaluation. 

This aspect of our Multilingual Project will be headed by Jesse Dance, but brief instructions on how to use Zig will be provided below. 

The apt package manager may provide a zig version, but it is not officially supported with the latest releases. To get the latest Zig version, visit https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#managers or https://ziglang.org/learn/getting-started/#direct for the direct download.
